I know. The name is pretty lame, because we had to come up with a name before we start the project and even learn anything about compilers and programming language design. In retrospect, I would have called it something like "Moore" or "Cell" (probably not good names either :disappointed:).

MPL is a programming language that I, along with 3 other fellow classmates, designed and implemented. It is a Domain Specific Language (DSL), meaning it does not work for everything. Instead, MPL deals with matrices and images. We wanted it to be concise, cool, and reasonable to implement because this is a ~2-month course project.
