Welcome. This blog contains both Chinese and English contents, mostly related to CS. 

In the past 23 years, I made dozens of attempts to write blog/journal/articles regularly, and it never worked. Therefore, I decided not to make that promise again. I will post things whenever I like.
<!-- I do think, however, the frequency of writing ($$\mu$$) is positively correlated with the quality of my life ($$Q$$). I hope $$\mu \rightarrow \infty$$ :grin:. -->

I will migrate some old posts in Chinese from `nimoni.org`, my last failed attempt to blog. I didn't really speak English back then, sorry.
