## News

- __October 2017__  Gave a talk at [DSLDI 2017](https://2017.splashcon.org/event/dsldi-2017-substance-and-style-domain-specific-languages-for-mathematical-diagrams) in Vancouver Canada
- __May 2017__  Started [REU-SE](http://isri.cmu.edu/education/reu-se/), a summer research program, at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Research

I am interested in __computer graphics, computer vision, and programming languages__. As a visual learner who happens to like designing and implementing programming languages, I would like to design new languages for graphics/vision applications.

## Education

B.S. in Computer Science, __Dickinson College__ <br>
B.S. in Computer Science, __Columbia University__ <br>

## My Name

My name is 倪沃德 (
    <audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>
)
in Chinese. __"Nimo"__ has been my alias since high school, during which I was a street dancer ([Popping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping)) and competed under this alias. In my early days in the US, my legal name, often written as "Wode", caused a lot of confusion, because it looks like a single word and people often pronounce it that way. Sadly, I have trouble answering to "
    <audio id="wode"><source src="assets/wode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('wode').play();"> Wode</a>
" in all conditions.
If you cannot pronounce (
    <audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>
)
 easily, try __"Nimo"__.
