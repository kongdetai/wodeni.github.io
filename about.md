## Research

I am interested in **programming languages, visualization, and human-computer interaction**. I am fascinated by how well-designed languages enable people to succinctly express abstract ideas in various domains (e.g. math, computer science, and beyond!), and how visual representations help people understand and reason about them. I aspire to **help people understand the abstract world** by designing and building powerful, useable languages and tools.

I am working on [**Penrose**](http://penrose.ink), a system that visualizes mathematics from high-level, declarative programs.

## Education

Ph.D. in Software Engineering, **Carnegie Mellon University**,
B.S. in Computer Science, **Columbia University**, _Magna cum laude_ <br>
B.S. in Computer Science, **Dickinson College**, _Summa cum laude_ <br>

<!-- Yes, I have two bachelor's degrees because I did the [Combined Plan Program](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/learn/academiclife/engineering/combined-plan-program). -->

## Personal

My name is 倪沃德 (<audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
<a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="documentkk.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>)
in Chinese. **"Nimo"** has been my alias since high school, during which I was a street dancer ([Popping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping)) and competed under this alias. My first name, often written as "Wode", looks like a single word in English and people often pronounce it that way. Sadly, I have trouble answering to "<audio id="wode"><source src="assets/wode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio> <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('wode').play();"> Wode</a> " under all circumstances. If you find it hard to pronounce ( <audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio> <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>), try **"Nimo"**.

If I'm not working, I play billiards. Coming from a [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker) background, I recently began to enjoy 9/8-ball as well. I am a member of CMU Pool Team and play competitively in [ACUI tournaments](https://www.acui.org/billiards/).

I also enjoy playing [Yo-yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo). Here are 4 different ways to form a [Green Triangle](http://yoyo.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Triangle):
