## Research

I am interested in __programming languages, computer graphics, and computer vision__. As a visual thinker who loves designing and implementing programming languages, I aspire to create new languages for graphics/vision applications. Currently, I am working on [Penrose](http://penrose.ink), a system that visualizes mathematics from high-level, declarative programs.

## Education

B.S. in Computer Science, __Columbia University__ (Expected 2018) <br>
B.S. in Computer Science, __Dickinson College__ (Expected 2018) <br>

Yes, I will have two bachelor's degrees because I participate in the [Combined Plan Program](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/learn/academiclife/engineering/combined-plan-program).

## Personal

My name is 倪沃德 (
    <audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>
)
in Chinese. __"Nimo"__ has been my alias since high school, during which I was a street dancer ([Popping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popping)) and competed under this alias. My first name, often written as "Wode", looks like a single word in English and people often pronounce it that way. Sadly, I have trouble answering to "
    <audio id="wode"><source src="assets/wode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('wode').play();"> Wode</a>
" under all circumstances. If you find it hard to pronounce (
    <audio id="pronounce"><source src="assets/niwode.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
    <a class="icon icon-volume" onclick="document.getElementById('pronounce').play();"> ní wò dé</a>
)
 , try __"Nimo"__.

I play [Yo-yo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo), and have won provincial contests. I mostly do [1A](http://yoyo.wikia.com/wiki/Styles_Of_Play). Here are 4 different ways to form a [Green Triangle](http://yoyo.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Triangle):

Broadly speaking, I am interested in many forms of [Object manipulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_manipulation), such as Zippo tricks and pen spinning.

I love billiards, especially [Snooker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snooker).
